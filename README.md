# Etch-a-Sketch

"Etch-a-Sketch" is a frontend project created as one of the exercises on TheOdinProject programming course. This project is a web-based implementation of the classic toy "Etch-a-Sketch" that allows users to draw and erase on a grid.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a grid of squares that the user can hover over to draw. The user can also choose the grid size, reset the grid to start over, and select between different colors to draw with.
